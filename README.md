# Fureeb-Modpack

 **Pack Version: 1.2**
 
 **Game Version: 1.12.2**

This is a modpack created by us, because the other ones
had too many mods and crashed our server. Plus, there
were only a handful of mods we wanted and none of the
existing packs catered to all of our wants for the server.

The Pack is called Fureeb, because half of the mods were
chosen by a weeb and half were chosen by an alleged furry.
(I'm not, but it's a running joke, so sure...)

### Mods chosen by the furry
 - Computercraft
 - Industrialcraft 2
 - Buildcraft

### Mods chosen by the weeb
 - Twilight Forest
 - Chocolate Quest Repoured
 - Infernal Mobs

### Mods chosen by both
 - Bibliocraft
 - Tinker's Construct
 - Mantle

### Util mods required by other mods
 - Mantle
 - Geckolib 3

If you want to install it and are new to Git (I don't see how you could be if you found this, but aight),
either download the zip and extract it into your 'mods' folder, or run the following command in your mods folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/long-schlong-gang/Fureeb-Modpack .
```
(Make sure to copy the full-stop at the end as well.)

If you've already cloned it and want to update it to the latest version, run the following commands in the mods folder:
```
git fetch
git pull
```
